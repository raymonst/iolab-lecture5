    Finally, let's add some interactions on the page:
    1. When the user hovers over a navigation link, make it animate (fade out) slightly.
    2. Make it so that the portfolio item's descriptive text is only visible after the user clicks the title.
    3. Think about other interactions that may make sense in this context. Code them and note your reason behind those functionalities.
