/*
    Let's create some visual structure on the page:
    1. Reset the css.
    2. Center the "container" div.
    3. Change the menu's appearance so it looks different than the main content.
    4. Change the portfolio item's title so it looks different than the body text.
    5. Add more styles as you see fit. Recall the "cascading" nature of CSS and make sure you're re-using as many styles as possible instead of specifying new ones for every single element.
