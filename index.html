<!-- 
    You are building a portfolio page:
    1. Create a "container" div where all your content will reside in.
    2. Create a menu using an unordered list.
    3. The main content area contains your works. Start with placeholder content for one portfolio item: an image, a title, and some descriptive text. The layout should look roughly as follows:

    ---------	TITLE
    |		|	lorem ipsum dolor amit
    |		|
    ---------

    4. Once you have successfully created one item, duplicate it. Pretend that you are displaying 4 items on this page.
